# SVG-Logo-Creator

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a Command-Line Application that automatically generates a logo based on given user inputs/responses to pre-defined prompts. As a freelance web developer working on several projects, it is important to have an application that can generate logos in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) formats. This can save significant amounts of time which can be utilized in writing code. 

The project was developed using Node.JS and also incorporated code libraries such as *Inquirer*, *Jest* e.t.c. The application runs on the Command-Line interface and is initialized by typing the command `node index.js`. When the application is initiated, the user is prompted to answer questions relating to the properties of the logo such as *shape color*, *textcolor*, *logo shape* and *logo text*.

Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of Node.js. I learnt how to apply the concepts of **Object Oriented Programming**, **Test-Driven-Development** and **Class Constructors**.
